Yep, I start blogging ðŸ˜Š, this is considered big jump for me in terms of my work and life attitude. I have been reluctant to express or share my experience and knowledge online in past 10 years as a developer. I think this needs to be changed, not only I want to get more involved in the online community, but also I think it is a good approach to memorize what I have learn at the time. The rest of article I will explain how to set up and deploy this simple blog using GatsbyJS and Netlify.
